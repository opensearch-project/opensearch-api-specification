## Welcome!

`opensearch-api-specification` is an open source, community-driven collection of API model specifications for
[OpenSearch](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch) APIs. The API models are created using the [Smithy](https://awslabs.github.io/smithy/) Interface Definition Language (IDL). Smithy is an open source IDL which is protocol agnostic, extensible and supports code generation.
