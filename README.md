## Welcome!

The `opensearch-api-specification` is an open source, community-driven collection of API model specifications for [OpenSearch](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch) APIs. The API models are written in OpenAPI format and are used to generate client libraries and documentation. You can find the latest release of the API specification [here](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-api-specification/releases).

### OpenSearch API Source of Truth

This repo aims to be the complete source of truth for OpenSearch and OpenSearch Dashboards REST APIs, including plugins. To be the source of truth, this repo [accurately represents APIs in YAML](spec/), and [publishes](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-api-specification/releases) a single-file OpenAPI 3.1.0 spec. The latter is used to [generate OpenSearch language clients](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-clients/issues/19), [generate mechanical parts of the OpenSearch documentation](https://github.com/opensearch-project/documentation-website/issues/7700), and will be used to [generate the OpenSearch server API itself](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/issues/3090).

### Working in this Repo

Because of our legacy, the specification is produced by reading the [OpenSearch documentation](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/) and reverse-engineering code. Thus, a good place to start contributing to this repo is to [identify a missing API and to add it](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-api-specification/issues/168) by following the [developer guide](DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md). This repo also contains a set of [test tools](TESTING_GUIDE.md) that ensure the correctness of this API and infrastructure that evaluates the gap between the OpenSearch server and this API spec by comparing REST routes registered in a running OpenSearch to the list of the APIs in this repo. You can see the latest API and test coverage numbers in the comments automatically added to any [recently merged pull requests](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-api-specification/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed).
