        shards:
          description: Number of primary and replica shards assigned to the node.
          type: string
        disk.indices:
          description: |-
            Disk space used by the node's shards. Does not include disk space for the translog or unassigned shards.
            IMPORTANT: This metric double-counts disk space for hard-linked files, such as those created when shrinking, splitting, or cloning an index.
          anyOf:
            - $ref: '_common.yaml#/components/schemas/ByteSize'
            - type: 'null'
        disk.used:
          description: |-
            Total disk space in use.
            OpenSearch retrieves this metric from the node's operating system (OS).
            The metric includes disk space for: OpenSearch, including the translog and unassigned shards; the node's operating system; any other applications or files on the node.
            Unlike `disk.indices`, this metric does not double-count disk space for hard-linked files.

            - $ref: '_common.yaml#/components/schemas/ByteSize'
            - type: 'null'
        disk.avail:
          description: |-
            Free disk space available to OpenSearch.
            OpenSearch retrieves this metric from the node's operating system.
            Disk-based shard allocation uses this metric to assign shards to nodes based on available disk space.

            - type: 'null'
        disk.percent:
          description: Total percentage of disk space in use. Calculated as `disk.used / disk.total`.
