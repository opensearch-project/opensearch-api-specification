* The [build-single-file-specs](.github/workflows/build-single-file-specs.yml) workflow raises a PR for the changes to the [./build/OpenSearch.latest.yaml](builds/OpenSearch.latest.yaml) whenever a change is made to the [spec folder](./spec).
* The updated OpenAPI specs are hosted on GitHub pages at https://opensearch-project.github.io/opensearch-api-specification/.
