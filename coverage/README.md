### API Coverage

Uses the [opensearch-api plugin](https://github.com/dblock/opensearch-api), and [openapi-diff](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-diff) to show the difference between OpenSearch APIs, and the [OpenAPI spec checked into this repo](../builds/OpenSearch.latest.yaml).

API coverage is run on all pull requests via the [coverage workflow](../.github/workflows/coverage.yml).
