### API Coverage

Builds the OpenAPI spec, and uses the [opensearch-api plugin](https://github.com/dblock/opensearch-api) and [openapi-diff](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-diff) to show the differences.

API coverage is run on all pull requests via the [coverage workflow](../.github/workflows/coverage.yml).
