### API Coverage

Builds the OpenAPI spec, and uses the [opensearch-api plugin](https://github.com/dblock/opensearch-api) and this repo's [coverage tool](../tools/README.md#coverage) to show the differences.

API coverage is run on all pull requests via the [Analyze PR Changes workflow](../.github/workflows/analyze-pr-changes.yml).
